        <h1>Jason's Cool Website</h1>
        <p>
            Welcome to the first webpage of the legendary software developer. You are very lucky to be here.

            I like coding. More the back-end, but I guess this is pretty fun too. Man, I would have made millions if I had been around in 1995.
            I have made a couple of pretty cool things. There's this one credit card thing that can sort what company a number is from. The math on those is really pretty complicated.

            I grew up (and still live in) Holland, MI. It's pretty much the coolest place in the world. There are TULIPS and WINDMILLS. How neat is that?
            My favorite restaurant might be the windmill restaurant. Aptly named place, amiright? They have good breakfast.
