            <h1>About Me</h1>
            <p>
                My name is Jason. I was born and raised in Holland, MI. I went to school for several years to become a doctor, then decided hey, I like sitting at a computer all day well enough, why not try to make a living of it?
            </p>
            <p>
                I like coding. More the back-end, but I guess this is pretty fun too. Man, this website would have been cutting edge in like 1993. 
                If you would like to see some of the back-end things I have made, you can head on over to my portfolio using that nifty nav bar at the top that I totally didn't lift directly from the internet.

                If you would like to contact me, sliiiide into my dm's on instagram I guess. Or you can email me. Social media links are at the bottom of the page.
                Gmail is that black square. Don't know why it's doing that.
